Display a badge (based the "badges") without requiring file-system access or knowledge of HTML.

== Description ==

Display "Badges" in the side-panel which points to a web-site and an image which is then used to build the "badge".
Using the Widget you can choose whether to:

1. (Optionally) display a Title
1. Link to a site
1. Required link to an image to mark that site (any size will work, but the "standard" seems to be 88 pixels wide by 31 pixels high)
1. Pad the Badge (including centering the text); some people may prefer using their own CSS, so this is an optional configuration.
1. Enable "Display Badge in a Box" (enabled by default)
1. Enable the Displaying of a Drop-Shadow

If more control is needed, or more badges need to be displayed, the [badges plugin](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/badges/ "Wordpress Plugin") on the Wordpress site might be a better fit.

1. Sit back and enjoy...

**Use the WordPress Plugin System**

1. Congratulate yourself on a sterling job.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I style the badges using CSS? =

Quite simply by using the `div.badge` class.

= How do I style a single badge? =

Every badge gets a unique ID generated by the plug-in based on the plugin-s name and the badge's container ID. This will likely look something like "inner-badge-[NUMBER]".

== Screenshots ==

1. Create a "Licensing" badge that points to the Creative Commons website and uses a CC 88x31 banner
2. The result of the configuration in No 1
3. Boxing a Badge to SpreadFirefox with an added drop-shadow
